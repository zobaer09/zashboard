Description: Zashboard lets you define a single dashboard spec and build it into three targets: static HTML, a Shiny app, or a Shinylive app. It includes light semantics for measures and relationships, supports cross-filtering in Shiny and safe interactivity in static builds, theming with 'bslib', and data sources via DuckDB/Arrow or Microsoft SQL Server (DBI/ODBC).
