# Zashboard

This repository contains a starter spec and scaffolding for the Zashboard R package.

- One spec builds static HTML, Shiny, and Shinylive.
- Light semantic layer for relationships and measures.
- Optional client-side analytics via DuckDB WASM or Arrow JS for static dashboards.
- Optional micro backend later for sensitive aggregates.

See `docs/SPEC.md` and `CHECKLIST.md` to begin.
